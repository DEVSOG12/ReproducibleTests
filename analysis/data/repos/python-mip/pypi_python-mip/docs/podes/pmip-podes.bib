@article{Parragh2013,
	Abstract = {Demographic change towards an ever aging population entails an increasing demand for specialized transportation systems to complement the traditional public means of transportation. Typically, users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup and a drop off location and a fleet of minibuses or taxis is used to serve these requests. The underlying optimization problem can be modeled as a dial-a-ride problem. In the dial-a-ride problem considered in this paper, total routing costs are minimized while respecting time window, maximum user ride time, maximum route duration, and vehicle capacity restrictions. We propose a hybrid column generation and large neighborhood search algorithm and compare different hybridization strategies on a set of benchmark instances from the literature.},

	Abstract = {We study two new problems in sequence alignment both from a practical and a theoretical view, using tools from combinatorial optimization to develop branch-and-cut algorithms. The generalized maximum trace formulation captures several forms of multiple sequence alignment problems in a common framework, among them the original formulation of maximum trace. The RNA sequence alignment problem captures the comparison of RNA molecules on the basis of their primary sequence and their secondary structure. Both problems have a characterization in terms of graphs which we reformulate in terms of integer linear programming. We then study the polytopes (or convex hulls of all feasible solutions) associated with the integer linear program for both problems. For each polytope we derive several classes of facet-defining inequalities and show that for some of these classes the corresponding separation problem can be solved in polynomial time. This leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment that is not based on dynamic programming. Moreover, for multiple sequences the branch-and-cut algorithms for both sequence alignment problems are able to solve to optimality instances that are beyond the range of present dynamic programming approaches.},

The proposed algorithm is a specific instantiation of a framework known from the literature as Generate-And-Solve, which is based on the following general idea. First, generate a reduced sub-instance of the original problem instance, in a way such that a solution to the sub-instance is also a solution to the original problem instance. Second, apply an exact solver to the reduced sub-instance in order to obtain a (possibly) high quality solution to the original problem instance. And third, make use of the results of the exact solver as feedback for the next algorithm iteration. The minimum common string partition problem and the minimum covering arborescence problem are chosen as test cases in order to demonstrate the application of the proposed algorithm. The obtained results show that the algorithm is competitive with the exact solver for small to medium size problem instances, while it significantly outperforms the exact solver for larger problem instances.},

@article{Bertsimas2004,
	Abstract = {A robust approach to solving linear optimization problems with uncertain data has been proposed in the early 1970s, and has recently been extensively studied and extended. Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data, in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper we propose an approach that attempts to make this tradeoff more attractive, that is we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. We thus naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

	Abstract = {Over the years, software cost estimation through sizing has led to the development of various estimating practices. Despite the uniqueness and unpredictability of the software processes, people involved in project resource management have always been striving for acquiring reliable and accurate software cost estimations. The difficulty of finding a concise set of factors affecting productivity is amplified due to the dependence on the nature of products, the people working on the project and the cultural environment in which software is built and thus effort estimations are still considered a challenge. This paper aims to provide size- and effort-based cost estimations required for the development of new software projects utilising data obtained from previously completed projects. The modelling approach employs different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) topologies and input/output schemes selected heuristically, which target at capturing the dynamics of cost behavior as this is expressed by the available data attributes. The ANNs are enhanced by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) whose role is to evolve the network architectures (both input and internal hidden layers) by reducing the Mean Relative Error (MRE) produced by the output results of each network. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

The detection of epileptiform discharges in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important part in the diagnosis of epilepsy. All data set were obtained from EEG signals of healthy subjects and subjects suffering from epilepsy diseases. For healthy subjects is background EEG (scalp) with open eyes and for epileptic patients correspond to a seizure recorded in hippocampus (epileptic focus) with depth electrodes. The evolution of proposed system was conducted using k-fold cross-validation, classification accuracy, and sensitivity and specificity values. We have obtained 98.68{\%} and 98.72{\%} classification accuracies using 5- and 10-fold cross-validation.

Two well-known methods are boosting (see, e.g., Shapire et al., 1998) and bagging Breiman (1996) of classification trees. In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction. In bagging, successive trees do not depend on earlier trees --- each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set. In the end, a simple majority vote is taken for prediction.},

	Abstract = {We present methods that are useful in solving some large scale hierarchical planning models involving 0-1 vanables. These 0-1 programming problems initially could not be solved with any standard techniques. We employed several approaches to take advantage of the hierarchical structure of variables (ordered by importance) and other structures present in the models. Critical, but not sufficient for success, was a strong linear programming formulation. We describe methods for strengthening the linear programs, as well as other techniques necessary for a commercial branch-and-bound code to be successful in solving these problems.

However, they are not always robust and tend to overfit the data. Additionally, if allowed to grow large, they lose interpretability. In this paper, we present a novel mixed integer programming formulation to construct optimal decision trees of specified size. We take special structure of categorical features into account and allow combinatorial decisions (based on subsets of values of such a feature) at each node. We show that very good accuracy can be achieved with small trees using moderately-sized training sets. The optimization problems we solve are easily tractable with modern solvers.},

	Abstract = {Roller bearing is one of the most widely used rotary elements in a rotary machine. The roller bearing's nature of vibration reveals its condition and the features that show the nature, are to be extracted through some indirect means. Statistical parameters like kurtosis, standard deviation, maximum value, etc. form a set of features, which are widely used in fault diagnostics. Often the problem is, finding out good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the bearing. Selection of good features is an important phase in pattern recognition and requires detailed domain knowledge. This paper illustrates the use of a Decision Tree that identifies the best features from a given set of samples for the purpose of classification. It uses Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM), which has the capability to efficiently classify the faults using statistical features. The vibration signal from a piezoelectric transducer is captured for the following conditions: good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault, and inner and outer race fault. The statistical features are extracted therefrom and classified successfully using PSVM and SVM. The results of PSVM and SVM are compared. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {{\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York The present paper introduces a learning-based optimization approach to the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem. Multiple projects, each with their own set of activities, need to be scheduled. The objectives dealt with here include minimization of the average project delay and total makespan. The availability of local and global resources, precedence relations between activities, and non-equal project start times have to be considered. The proposed approach relies on a simple sequence learning game played by a group of project managers. The project managers each learn their activity list locally using reinforcement learning, more specifically learning automata. Meanwhile, they learn how to choose a suitable place in the overall sequence of all activity lists. All the projects need to arrive at a unique place in this sequence. A mediator, who usually has to solve a complex optimization problem, now manages a simple dispersion game. Through the mediator, a sequence of feasible activity lists is eventually scheduled by using a serial schedule generation scheme, which is adopted from single project scheduling. It is shown that the sequence learning approach has a large positive effect on minimizing the average project delay. In fact, the combination of local reinforcement learning, the sequence learning game and a forward-backward implementation of the serial scheduler significantly improves the best known results for all the MPSPLIB datasets. In addition, several new best results were obtained for both considered objectives: minimizing the average project delay and minimizing the total makespan.},

	Abstract = {{\copyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and The Mathematical Programming Society.Implementations of the simplex method differ mostly in specific aspects such as the pivot rule. Similarly, most relaxation methods for mixed-integer programming differ mostly in the type of cuts and the exploration of the search tree. We provide a scripting mechanism to easily implement and experiment with primal and dual pivot rules for the simplex method, by building upon COIN-OR's open-source linear programming package CLP, without explicitly interacting with the underlying C+ + layers of CLP. In the same manner, users can customize the solution process of mixed-integer linear programs using the CBC and CGL COIN-OR packages by coding branch-and-cut strategies and cut generators in Python. The Cython programming language ensures communication between Python and C+ + libraries and activates user-defined customizations as callbacks. Our goal is to emphasize the ease of development in Python while maintaining acceptable performance. The resulting software, named CyLP, has become a part of COIN-OR and is available under open-source terms. For illustration, we provide an implementation of the positive edge rule---a recently proposed rule that is particularly efficient on degenerate problems---and demonstrate how to customize branch-and-cut node selection in the solution of a mixed-integer program.},

	Abstract = {A Project Scheduling Problem consists in deciding who does what during the software project lifetime. This is a capital issue in the practice of software engineering, since the total budget and human resources involved must be managed opti- mally in order to end in a successful project. In short, companies are principally concerned with reducing the duration and cost of projects, and these two goals are in conflict with each other. In this work we tackle the problem by using genetic algorithms (GAs) to solve many different software project scenarios. Thanks to our newly developed instance generator we can perform structured studies on the influence the most important problem attributes have on the solutions. Our conclu- sions show that GAs are quite flexible and accurate for this application, and an important tool for automatic project management.},

Typically, users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup and a drop off location and a fleet of minibuses or taxis is used to serve these requests. The underlying optimization problem can be modeled as a dial-a-ride problem. In the dial-a-ride problem considered in this paper, total routing costs are minimized while respecting time window, maximum user ride time, maximum route duration, and vehicle capacity restrictions. We propose a hybrid column generation and large neighborhood search algorithm and compare different hybridization strategies on a set of benchmark instances from the literature.},

@article{Belotti2016,
	Abstract = {{\copyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Mixed integer programming (MIP) is commonly used to model indicator constraints, i.e., constraints that either hold or are relaxed depending on the value of a binary variable. Unfortunately, those models tend to lead to weak continuous relaxations and turn out to be unsolvable in practice; this is what happens, for e.g., in the case of Classification problems with Ramp Loss functions that represent an important application in this context. In this paper we show the computational evidence that a relevant class of these Classification instances can be solved far more efficiently if a nonlinear, nonconvex reformulation of the indicator constraints is used instead of the linear one. Inspired by this empirical and surprising observation, we show that aggressive bound tightening is the crucial ingredient for solving this class of instances, and we devise a pair of computationally effective algorithmic approaches that exploit it within MIP. One of these methods is currently part of the arsenal of IBM-Cplex since version 12.6.1. More generally, we argue that aggressive bound tightening is often overlooked in MIP, while it represents a significant building block for enhancing MIP technology when indicator constraints and disjunctive terms are present.},

Some authors could obtain reduced duality gaps by also using a restricted num-ber of cuts over the Master LP variables, stopping separation before the pricing becomes prohibitively hard. This work introduces a technique for greatly decreas-ing the impact on the pricing of the Subset Row Cuts, thus allowing much more such cuts to be added. The newly proposed Branch-Cut-and-Price algorithm also incorporates and combines for the first time (often in an improved way) several elements found in previous works, like route enumeration and strong branching. All the instances used for benchmarking exact algorithms, with up to 199 cus-tomers, were solved to optimality. Moreover, some larger instances with up to 360 customers, only considered before by heuristic methods, were solved too.},

Since CTTP is a NP-hard problem for nearly all of its variants, the use of heuristic methods for its resolution is justified. This paper presents an efficient Tabu Search (TS) heuristic with two different memory based diversification strategies for CTTP. Results obtained through an application of the method to a set of real world problems show that it produces better solutions than a previously proposed TS found in the literature and faster times are observed in the production of good quality solutions.},

@article{Lawler,
	Abstract = {This chapter discusses different types of sequencing and scheduling problems, and describes different types of algorithms and the concepts of complexity theory. A class of deterministic machine scheduling problems has been introduced in the chapter. The chapter also deals with the single machine, parallel machine and multi-operation problems in this class, respectively. The two generalizations of the deterministic machine-scheduling model have been presented in the chapter. A deterministic scheduling model may give rise to various stochastic counterparts, as there is a choice in the parameters that are randomized, in their distributions, and in the classes of policies that can be applied. A characteristic feature of these models is that the stochastic parameters are regarded as independent random variables with a given distribution and that their realization occurs only after the scheduling decision has been made. In the deterministic model, one has perfect information, and capitalizing on it in minimizing the realization of a performance measure may require exponential time. {\copyright} 1993, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

The objective is to optimize mineral extraction in the mines by minimizing the number of mining trucks used to meet production goals and quality requirements. According to the literature, this problem is NP-hard, so a heuristic strategy is justified. We present a hybrid algorithm that combines characteristics of two metaheuristics: Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures and General Variable Neighborhood Search. The proposed algorithm was tested using a set of real-data problems and the results were validated by running the CPLEX optimizer with the same data. This solver used a mixed integer programming model also developed in this work. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive, finding near optimal solutions (with a gap of less than 1{\%}) in most instances, demanding short computing times. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A branch-and-bound algorithm (B{\&}B) is developed and a solution provided by the metaheuristic GRASP is used as an upper bound. We also propose a set of instances for this type of problem. The results are compared to the solutions provided by two mixed integer programming models (MIP) with the solver CPLEX 9.0. We carry out computational experiments and the algorithm performs extremely well on instances with up to 30 jobs.},

@book{Fischetti2010,
	Abstract = {Modern Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers exploit a rich arsenal of tools to attack hard problems. It is widely accepted by the OR community that the solution of very hard MIPs can take advantage from the solution of a series of time-consuming auxiliary Linear Programs (LPs) intended to enhance the performance of the overall MIP solver. For instance, auxiliary LPs may be solved to generate powerful disjunctive cuts, or to implement a strong branching policy. Also well established is the fact that finding good-quality heuristic MIP solutions often requires a computing time that is just comparable to that needed to solve the LP relaxations. So, it makes sense to think of a new generation of MIP solvers where auxiliary MIPs (as opposed to LPs) are heuristically solved on the fly, with the aim of bringing the MIP technology under the chest of the MIP solver itself. This leads to the idea of ``translating into a MIP model'' (MIPping) some crucial decisions to be taken within a MIP algorithm (How to cut? How to improve the incumbent solution? Is the current node dominated?). In this paper we survey a number of successful applications of the above approach.},

@techreport{Sandholm2006,
	Abstract = {Nogood learning has proven to be an effective CSP technique critical to success in today's top SAT solvers. We extend the technique for use in integer programming and mixed integer programming. Our technique generates globally valid cutting planes for the 0-1 IP search algorithm from information learned through constraint propagation (bounds propagation). Nogoods (cutting planes) are generated not only from infeasibility but also from bounding. All of our techniques are geared toward yielding tighter LP upper bounds, and thus smaller search trees. Experiments suggest that our nogood learning does not help in integer programming because few cutting planes are generated, and they are weak. We explain why, and identify problem characteristics that affect the effectiveness. We show how problem structure, such as mutual exclusivity of indicator variables, or at least one of a set of indicator variables having to be ``on'', can be used to enhance the technique. We show this also for instances that exhibit multiple occurrences of each of the two structures. We then generalize the technique to mixed-integer programming. Then we compare our techniques to Achterberg's parallel invention of an almost identical approach. This comparison yields conclusions about what techniques within the nogood learning framework for (mixed) integer programming are essential for obtaining speedup. Finally, we lay out several directions for future research down this new and potentially promising avenue.},

	Abstract = {{\copyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. In the Generalized Assignment Problem, tasks must be allocated to machines with limited resources, in order to minimize processing costs. This problem has several industrial applications and often appears as substructure of other combinatorial optimization problems. By harnessing the massive computational power of Graphics Processing Units in a Scatter Search metaheuristic framework, we propose a method that efficiently generates a solution pool using a Tabu list criteria and an Ejection Chain mechanism. Common characteristics are extracted from the pool and solutions are combined by exploring a restricted search space, as a Binary Programming model. Classic instances vary from 100--1600 jobs and 5--80 agents, but due to the big amount of optimal and near-optimal solutions found by our method, we propose novel large-sized instances up to 9000 jobs and 600 agents. Results indicate that the method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms in literature.},

In OR practice and research, software is fundamental. The dependence of OR on software implies that the ways in which software is developed, managed, and distributed can have a significant impact on the field. Open source is a relatively new software development and distribution model which offers advantages over current practices. Its viability depends on the precise definition of open source, on the culture of a distributed developer community, and on a version-control system which makes distributed development possible. In this paper, we review open-source philosophy and culture, and present the goals and status of COIN-OR.},

Robust optimization is very useful for practice, since it is tailored to the information at hand, and it leads to computationally tractable formulations. It is therefore remarkable that real-life applications of robust optimization are still lagging behind; there is much more potential for real-life applications than has been exploited hitherto. The aim of this paper is to help practitioners to understand robust optimization and to successfully apply it in practice. We provide a brief introduction to robust optimization, and also describe important do's and don'ts for using it in practice. We use many small examples to illustrate our discussions.},

	Abstract = {We present a new framework for finding feasible solutions to mixed integer programs (MIP). We use the feasibility pump heuristic coupled to a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). The feasibility pump heuristic attempts to find a feasible solution to a MIP by first rounding a solution to the linear programming (LP) relaxation to an integer (but not necessarily feasible) solution and then projecting it to a feasible solution to the LP relaxation. The BRKGA is able to build a pool of projected and rounded but not necessarily feasible solutions and to combine them using information from previous projections. This information is also used to fix variables during the process to speed up the solution of the LP relaxations, and to reduce the problem size in enumeration phases. Experimental results show that this approach is able to find feasible solutions for instances where the original feasibility pump or a commercial mixed integer programming solver often fail.},

@article{Asta2015,
	Abstract = {Hyper-heuristics have emerged as automated high level search methodologies that manage a set of low level heuristics for solving computationally hard problems. A generic selection hyper-heuristic combines heuristic selection and move acceptance methods under an iterative single point-based search framework. At each step, the solution in hand is modified after applying a selected heuristic and a decision is made whether the new solution is accepted or not. In this study, we represent the trail of a hyper-heuristic as a third order tensor. Factorization of such a tensor reveals the latent relationships between the low level heuristics and the hyper-heuristic itself. The proposed learning approach partitions the set of low level heuristics into two subsets where heuristics in each subset are associated with a separate move acceptance method. Then a multi-stage hyper-heuristic is formed and while solving a given problem instance, heuristics are allowed to operate only in conjunction with the associated acceptance method at each stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time tensor analysis of the space of heuristics is used as a data science approach to improve the performance of a hyper-heuristic in the prescribed manner. The empirical results across six different problem domains from a benchmark indeed indicate the success of the proposed approach.},

Feasibility Pump (FP) is a heuristic scheme for finding a feasible$\backslash$nsolution to general MIPs that can be viewed as a clever way to round a sequence of fractional solutions of the LP relaxation,$\backslash$nuntil a feasible one is eventually found. In this paper we study the effect of replacing the original rounding function (which$\backslash$nis fast and simple, but somehow blind) with more clever rounding heuristics. In particular, we investigate the use of a diving-like$\backslash$nprocedure based on rounding and constraint propagation---a basic tool in Constraint Programming. Extensive computational results$\backslash$non binary and general integer MIPs from the literature show that the new approach produces a substantial improvement of the$\backslash$nFP success rate, without slowing-down the method and with a significantly better quality of the feasible solutions found.},

@article{Awadallah2017,
	Abstract = {? 2015 The Natural Computing Applications ForumThis paper proposes a hybrid harmony search algorithm (HHSA) for solving the highly constrained nurse rostering problem (NRP). The NRP is a combinatorial optimization problem tackled by assigning a set of shifts to a set of nurses; each has specific skills and work contract, to a predefined rostering period according to a set of constraints. The harmony search is a metaheuristic approach, where the metaheuristics are the most successful methods for tackling this problem. In HHSA, the harmony search algorithm is hybridized with the hill climbing optimizer to empower its exploitation capability. Furthermore, the memory consideration operator of the HHSA is modified by replacing the random selection scheme with the global-best concept of particle swarm optimization to accelerate its convergence rate. The standard dataset published in the first international nurse rostering competition 2010 (INRC2010) was utilized to evaluate the proposed HHSA. Several convergence scenarios have been employed to study the effects of the two HHSA modifications. Finally, a comparative evaluation against twelve other methods that worked on the INRC2010 dataset is carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved five new best results, and 33 best published results out of 69 instances as achieved by other comparative methods.},

	Abstract = {Some instances of high school timetabling problems, taken from institutions in several countries and specified formally in a common XML format, have recently become available [12]. For the first time, the high school timetabling problem can be studied in its full generality. KHE is an open-source ANSI C library, released under the GNU public licence, which aims to provide a fast and robust foundation for solving instances of high school timetabling problems expressed in the new format. Users of KHE may read and write XML files, create solutions, and add and change time and resource assignments using any algorithms they wish. The cost of the current solution is always available, kept up to date by a hand-coded constraint propagation network. KHE also offers features inherited from the author's KTS system [7, 9], notably layer trees and matchings, and solvers for several major sub-tasks. KHE is intended for production use, but it is also a research vehicle, so new versions will not be constrained by backward compatibility. I will release a corrected version within a few days of receiving a bug report, wherever possible. Please report bugs to me at jeff@it.usyd.edu.au . This introductory chapter explains how to install and use KHE, surveys its data types, and describes some operations common to many types.},

	Abstract = {During the last decades, much research has been conducted deriving classes of valid inequalities for single-row mixed integer programming polyhedrons. However, no such class has had as much practical success as the MIR inequality when used in cutting plane algorithms for general mixed integer programming problems. In this work we analyze this empirical observation by developing an algorithm which takes as input a point and a single-row mixed integer polyhedron, and either proves the point is in the convex hull of said polyhedron, or finds a separating hyperplane. The main feature of this algorithm is a specialized subroutine for solving the Mixed Integer Knapsack Problem which exploits cost and lexicographic dominance. Separating over the entire closure of single-row systems allows us to establish natural benchmarks by which to evaluate specific classes of knapsack cuts. Using these benchmarks on Miplib 3.0 instances we analyze the performance of MIR inequalities. Computations are performed in exact arithmetic. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	Abstract = {Surgical scheduling is a challenging problem faced by hospital managers. It is subject to a wide range of constraints depending upon the particular situation within any given hospital. We deal with the simultaneous employment of specialised human resources, which must be assigned to surgeries according to their skills as well as the time windows of the staff. A particular feature is that they can be assigned to two surgeries simultaneously if the rooms are compatible. The objective is to maximise the use of the operating rooms. We propose an integer model and integer programming based heuristics to address the problem. Computational experiments were conducted on a number of scenarios inspired by real data to cover different practical problem solving situations. Numerical results show that relaxations provide tight upper bounds, and relax-and-fix heuristics are successful in finding optimal or near optimal solutions.},

	Abstract = {Robust optimization is still a relatively new approach to optimization problems affected by uncertainty, but it has already proved so useful in real applications that it is difficult to tackle such problems today without considering this powerful methodology. Written by the principal developers of robust optimization, and describing the main achievements of a decade of research, this is the first book to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject.Robust optimization is designed to meet some major challenges associated with uncertainty-affected optimization problems: to operate under lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty; to model the problem in a form that can be solved efficiently; and to provide guarantees about the performance of the solution.The book starts with a relatively simple treatment of uncertain linear programming, proceeding with a deep analysis of the interconnections between the construction of appropriate uncertainty sets and the classical chance constraints (probabilistic) approach. It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems. The theory is supported by numerous examples and computational illustrations.An essential book for anyone working on optimization and decision making under uncertainty,Robust Optimizationalso makes an ideal graduate textbook on the subject. {\copyright} 2009 by Princeton University Press.

	Abstract = {State-of-the-art decision tree methods apply heuristics recursively to create each split in isolation, which may not capture well the underlying characteristics of the dataset. The optimal decision tree problem attempts to resolve this by creating the entire decision tree at once to achieve global optimality. In the last 25 years, algorithmic advances in inte-ger optimization coupled with hardware improvements have resulted in an astonishing 800 billion factor speedup in mixed-integer optimization (MIO). Motivated by this speedup, we present optimal classification trees, a novel formulation of the decision tree problem using modern MIO techniques that yields the optimal decision tree for axes-aligned splits. We also show the richness of this MIO formulation by adapting it to give optimal classification trees with hyperplanes that generates optimal decision trees with multivariate splits. Synthetic tests demonstrate that these methods recover the true decision tree more closely than heuristics, refuting the notion that optimal methods overfit the training data. We comprehensively bench-mark these methods on a sample of 53 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. We establish that these MIO methods are practically solvable on real-world datasets with sizes in the 1000s, and give average absolute improvements in out-of-sample accuracy over CART of 1--2 and 3--5{\%} for the univariate and multivariate cases, respectively. Furthermore, we identify that optimal classification trees are likely to outperform CART by 1.2--1.3{\%} in situations where the CART accuracy is high and we have sufficient training data, while the multivariate version outperforms CART by 4--7{\%} when the CART accuracy or dimension of the dataset is low.},

	Abstract = {Gomory mixed-integer cuts (GMICs) are widely used in modern branchand-cut codes for the solution of mixed-integer programs. Typically, GMICs are iteratively generated from the optimal basis of the current linear programming (LP) relaxation, and immediately added to the LP before the next round of cuts is generated. Unfortunately, this approach is prone to instability. In this paper we analyze a different scheme for the generation of rank-1 GMICs read from a basis of the original LP---the one before the addition of any cut.We adopt a relax-and-cut approach where the generated GMICs are not added to the current LP, but immediately relaxed in a Lagrangian fashion. Various elaborations of the basic idea are presented, that lead to very fast---yet accurate---variants of the basic scheme. Very encouraging computational results are presented, with a comparison with alternative techniques from the literature also aimed at improving the GMIC quality. We also show how our method can be integrated with other cut generators, and successfully used in a cut-and-branch enumerative framework.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  A recent trend in local search concerns the exploitation of several different neighborhoods so as to increase the ability$\backslash$nof the algorithm to navigate the search space. In this work we investigate a hybridization technique, that we call Neighborhood Portfolio Approach, that consists in the interleave of local search techniques based on various combinations of neighborhoods. In particular,$\backslash$nwe are able to select the most effective search technique through a systematic analysis of all meaningful combinations built$\backslash$nupon a set of basic neighborhoods. The proposed approach is applied to two practical problems belonging to the timetabling$\backslash$nfamily, and systematically tested and compared on real-world instances. The experimental analysis shows that our approach$\backslash$nleads to automatic design of new algorithms that provide better results than basic local search techniques.},

	Abstract = {The feasibility pump (FP) has proved to be an effective method for finding feasible solutions to mixed integer programming problems. FP iterates between a rounding procedure and a projection procedure, which together provide a sequence of points alternating between LP feasible but fractional solutions, and integer but LP infeasible solutions. The process attempts to minimize the distance between consecutive iterates, producing an integer feasible solution when closing the distance between them. We investigate the benefits of enhancing the rounding procedure with a clever integer line search that efficiently explores a large set of integer points. An extensive computational study on benchmark instances demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

Railroad operations are directly influenced by their performance. In this paper, we present a rail yard simulation framework, or YardSim, and describe how it has been used to model a major hump yard on a Class I railroad in the US. The framework, that models complicated rail yard operations from inbound arrivals, inspection, switching, assembling, brake test, to outbound departures, can be used to pinpoint bottlenecks, identify improvement opportunities in operating practice and yard infrastructure, and assess the impact of changes in traffic volume and service plan. The YardSim provides the flexibility and adaptability to conduct and manage "what-if" analysis on train plan, yard infrastructure, operating policy, operational strategy, and yard resources such as crews and locomotives. Therefore, the development cycle for a new yard can be reduced significantly.},

	Abstract = {The project scheduling problem domain is an important research and applications area of engineering management. Recently introduced project scheduling software such as Risk+, Risk for Project, SCRAM and Risk Master have facilitated the use of simulation to solve project scheduling problems with stochastic task durations. Practitioners, however, should be made aware that the solution algorithm used in these software systems is based on the implicit assumption of perfect information, an assumption that jeopardizes the feasibility of solution results. This paper discusses the impact of assuming perfect information, introduces a multi-period stochastic programming based model of the project scheduling problem with stochastic task durations, and presents an alternative simulation algorithm that does not assume the availability of perfect information. A simple case study is used to illustrate the practical implications of applying simulation to address project scheduling problems with stochastic task durations.},

	Abstract = {The polyhedron defined by all the split cuts obtainable directly (i.e. without iterated cut generation) from the {\{}LP-relaxation{\}} P of a mixed integer program ({\{}MIP){\}} is termed the (elementary, or rank 1) split closure of P. This paper deals with the problem of optimizing over the elementary split closure. This is accomplished by repeatedly solving the following separation problem: given a fractional point, say x, find a rank-1 split cut violated by x or show that none exists. Following Caprara and Letchford [17], we formulate this separation problem as a nonlinear mixed integer program that can be treated as a parametric mixed integer linear program ({\{}PMILP){\}} with a single parameter in the objective function and the right hand side. We develop an algorithmic framework to deal with the resulting {\{}PMILP{\}} by creating and maintaining a dynamically updated grid of parameter values, and use the corresponding mixed integer programs to generate rank 1 split cuts. Our approach was implemented in the {\{}COIN-OR{\}} framework using {\{}CPLEX{\}} 9.0 as a general purpose {\{}MIP{\}} solver. We report our computational results on well-known benchmark instances from {\{}MIPLIB{\}} 3.0 and several classes of structured integer and mixed integer problems. Our computational results show that rank-1 split cuts close more than 98{\%} of the duality gap on 15 out of 41 mixed integer instances from {\{}MIPLIB{\}} 3.0. More than 75{\%} of the duality gap can be closed on an additional 10 instances. The average gap closed over all 41 instances is 72.78{\%}. In the pure integer case, rank-1 split cuts close more than 75{\%} of the duality gap on 13 out of 24 instances from {\{}MIPLIB{\}} 3.0. On average, rank 1 split cuts close about 72{\%} of the duality gap on these 24 instances. We also report results on several classes of structured problems: capacitated versions of warehouse location, single-source facility location, p-median, fixed charge network flow, multi-commodity network design with splittable and unsplittable flows, and lot sizing. The fraction of the integrality gap closed varies for these problem classes between 100 and 67{\%}. We also gathered statistics on the average coefficient size (absolute value) of the disjunctions generated. They turn out to be surprisingly small.},

	Abstract = {Summary The middleware solutions for General-Purpose Distributed Computing (GPDC) have distinct requirements, such as task scheduling, processing/storage fault tolerance, code portability for parallel or distributed environments, simple deployment (including over grid or multi-cluster environments), collaborative development, low code refactoring, native support for distributed data structures, asynchronous task execution, and support for distributed global variables. These solutions do not integrate these requirements into a single deployment with a unique API exposing most of these requirements to users. The consequence is the utilization of several solutions with their particularities, thus requiring different user skills. Besides that, the users have to solve the integration and all heterogeneity issues. To reduce this integration gap, in this paper, we present Java C{\'a}{\&}L{\'a} (JCL), a distributed-shared-memory and task-oriented lightweight middleware for the Java community that separates business logic from distribution issues during the development process and incorporates several requirements that were presented separately in the GPDC middleware literature over the last few decades. JCL allows building distributed or parallel applications with only a few portable API calls, thus reducing the integration problems. Finally, it also runs on different platforms, including small single-board computers. This work compares and contrasts JCL with other Java middleware systems and reports experimental evaluations of JCL applications in several distinct scenarios.},

Our study demonstrates that a generic implementation of a branch-and-price algorithm using specific pricing oracle yields comparatively good performance for this problem. We use our black-box branch-and-price solver BaPCod, relying on its generic branching scheme and primal heuristics. We developed a dynamic programming algorithm for pricing when the conflict graph is an interval graph, and a depth-first-search branch-and-bound approach for pricing when the conflict graph has no special structure. The exact method is tested on instances from the literature where the conflict graph is an interval graph, as well as harder instances that we generated with an arbitrary conflict graph and larger number of items per bin. Our computational experiment report sets new benchmark results for this problem, closing all open instances of the literature in one hour of CPU time.},

	Abstract = {Multi-label learning originated from the investigation of text categorization problem, where each document may belong to several predefined topics simultaneously. In multi-label learning, the training set is composed of instances each associated with a set of labels, and the task is to predict the label sets of unseen instances through analyzing training instances with known label sets. In this paper, a multi-label lazy learning approach named ML-KNN is presented, which is derived from the traditional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. In detail, for each unseen instance, its K nearest neighbors in the training set are firstly identified. After that, based on statistical information gained from the label sets of these neighboring instances, i.e. the number of neighboring instances belonging to each possible class, maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle is utilized to determine the label set for the unseen instance. Experiments on three different real-world multi-label learning problems, i.e. Yeast gene functional analysis, natural scene classification and automatic web page categorization, show that ML-KNN achieves superior performance to some well-established multi-label learning algorithms. {\copyright} 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with uncertain activity durations. An adaptive robust optimization model is proposed to derive the resource allocation decisions that minimize the worst-case makespan, under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. The properties of the model are analyzed, assuming that the activity durations are subject to interval uncertainty where the level of robustness is controlled by a protection factor related to the risk aversion of the decision maker. A general decomposition approach is proposed to solve the robust counterpart of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem, further tailored to address the uncertainty set with the protection factor. An extensive computational study is presented on benchmark instances adapted from the PSPLIB.},

In this case, the activity durations are represented by random variables with different probability distribution functions. To deal with this problem, we propose an approach based on the robust optimization concept, which produces reasonably good solutions under any likely input data scenario. Depending on different uncertainty characteristics, we have developed six different heuristics to incorporate the uncertain duration as a deterministic constraint in a robust optimization model. The resulting optimization model is then solved by using a Coin-Branch {\&} Cut (CBC) solver. To judge the performance of the algorithm, we solved 30, 60, 90 and 120-activity benchmark problems from the project scheduling problem library (PSPLIB). Our proposed approach guarantees the feasibility of solutions and produces high-quality solutions, particularly for larger activity instances, compared to other existing approaches.},

	Abstract = {{\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. Methods based on Stochastic Local Search (SLS) have been ranked as the best heuristics available for many hard combinatorial optimization problems. The design of SLS methods which use many neighborhoods poses difficult questions regarding the exploration of these neighborhoods: how much computational effort should be invested in each neighborhood? Should this effort remain fixed during the entire search or should it be dynamically updated as the search progresses? Additionally, is it possible to learn the best configurations during runtime without sacrificing too much the computational efficiency of the search method? In this paper we explore different tuning strategies to configure a state-of-the-art algorithm employing fourteen neighborhoods for the Multi-Mode Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem. An extensive set of computational experiments provide interesting insights for neighborhood selection and improved upper bounds for many hard instances from the literature.},

By generalizing various aspects of project scheduling, decision makers are enabled to capture reality and act accordingly. In the context of the MISTA 2013 conference, the first MISTA challenge, organized by the authors, introduced such a general problem model: the Multi-Mode Resource-Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (MRCMPSP). The present paper reports on the competition and provides a discussion on its results. Furthermore, it provides an analysis of the submitted algorithms, and a study of their common elements. By making all benchmark datasets and results publicly available, further research on the MRCMPSP is stimulated.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

The lower bounds are evaluated through linear-programming (LP) relaxations of two different integer linear formulations. Efficient resource-constraint propagation algorithms serve as a preprocessing technique for these relaxations. The originality of our approach is to use additionally some deductions performed by constraint propagation, and particularly by the shaving technique, to derive new cutting planes that strengthen the linear programs. Such new valid linear inequalities are given in this paper, as well as a computational. analysis of our approach. Through this analysis, we also compare the two considered linear formulations for the RCPSP and confirm the efficiency of lower bounds computed in a destructive way.},

	Abstract = {In a rapidly changing and highly uncertain environment, Petri net-based project management systems can be used in the rescheduling (control reconfiguration) of projects, when unforeseen changes occur or new data estimates become available. However, having to reschedule the project after it has started can result in significant suboptimality due to increased cost. In this paper, we present a solution method which is, to a large extent, robust to data uncertainty and does not require rescheduling for a certain predefined level of uncertainty. We build the model using robust optimisation techniques which address data uncertainty in project parameters, by taking advantage of risk pooling and without knowledge of their probability distributions. We illustrate that the total cost when the robust solution is used is generally lower than the cost of reconfiguring the deterministic solution, or than a penalty cost due to overtime of the deterministic solution, for a high enough penalty cost per time unit. We find that the robust solution is better protected against constraint violations, including time and cost overruns. Copyright 2009, Inderscience Publishers.},

Project Scheduling: A Research Handbook has been divided into four parts. Part I consists of three chapters on the scope and relevance of project scheduling, on the nature of project scheduling, and finally on the introduction of a unified scheme that will be used in subsequent chapters for the identification and classification of the project scheduling problems studied in this book. Part II focuses on the time analysis of project networks. Part III carries the discussion further into the crucial topic of scheduling under scarce resources. Part IV deals with robust scheduling and stochastic scheduling issues. Numerous tables and figures are used throughout the book to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the discussions. For the interested and motivated reader, the problems at the end of each chapter should be considered as an integral part of the presentation.},

Feasibility Pump (FP) is a heuristic scheme for finding a feasible$\backslash$nsolution to general MIPs that can be viewed as a clever way to round a sequence of fractional solutions of the LP relaxation,$\backslash$nuntil a feasible one is eventually found. In this paper we study the effect of replacing the original rounding function (which$\backslash$nis fast and simple, but somehow blind) with more clever rounding heuristics. In particular, we investigate the use of a diving-like$\backslash$nprocedure based on rounding and constraint propagation---a basic tool in Constraint Programming. Extensive computational results$\backslash$non binary and general integer MIPs from the literature show that the new approach produces a substantial improvement of the$\backslash$nFP success rate, without slowing-down the method and with a significantly better quality of the feasible solutions found.},

The feasibility pump heuristic attempts to find a feasible solution to a MIP by first rounding a solution to the linear programming (LP) relaxation to an integer (but not necessarily feasible) solution and then projecting it to a feasible solution to the LP relaxation. The BRKGA is able to build a pool of projected and rounded but not necessarily feasible solutions and to combine them using information from previous projections. This information is also used to fix variables during the process to speed up the solution of the LP relaxations, and to reduce the problem size in enumeration phases. Experimental results show that this approach is able to find feasible solutions for instances where the original feasibility pump or a commercial mixed integer programming solver often fail.},

	Abstract = {Gomory mixed-integer cuts (GMICs) are widely used in modern branchand-cut codes for the solution of mixed-integer programs. Typically, GMICs are iteratively generated from the optimal basis of the current linear programming (LP) relaxation, and immediately added to the LP before the next round of cuts is generated. Unfortunately, this approach is prone to instability. In this paper we analyze a different scheme for the generation of rank-1 GMICs read from a basis of the original LP---the one before the addition of any cut.We adopt a relax-and-cut approach where the generated GMICs are not added to the current LP, but immediately relaxed in a Lagrangian fashion. Various elaborations of the basic idea are presented, that lead to very fast---yet accurate---variants of the basic scheme. Very encouraging computational results are presented, with a comparison with alternative techniques from the literature also aimed at improving the GMIC quality. We also show how our method can be integrated with other cut generators, and successfully used in a cut-and-branch enumerative framework.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD \ensuremath{\leq} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	Abstract = {The name integer programming refers to the class of constrained optimization prob- lems in which some or all of the variables are required to be integers. In the most widely studied and used integer programs, the objective function is linear and the constraints are linear inequalities. The field of integer programming has achieved great success in the academic and business worlds. Hundreds of papers are published every year in a variety of journals, several international conferences are held annu- ally and software for solving integer programs, both commercial and open source, is widely available and used by thousands of organizations. The application areas in- clude logistics and supply chains, telecommunications, finance, manufacturing and many others. This book is dedicated to the theoretical, algorithmic and computational aspects of integer programming. While it is not a textbook, it can be read as an introduction to the field and provides a historical perspective. Graduate students, academics and practitioners, even those who have spent most of their careers in discrete optimiza- tion, will all find something useful to learn from the material in this book. Given the amount that has been accomplished, it is remarkable that the field of integer programming began only fifty years ago. The 12th Combinatorial Optimization Workshop AUSSOIS 2008 took place in Aussois, France, 7--11 January 2008. The workshop, entitled Fifty Years of Inte- ger Programming, and this book, which resulted from the workshop, were created to celebrate the 50th anniversary of integer programming. The workshop had a to- tal of 136 participants from 14 countries ranging in experience from pioneers who founded the field to current graduate students. In addition to the formal program, the workshop provided many opportunities for informal discussions among participants as well as a chance to enjoy the spectacular Alpine setting provided by Aussois. The book is organized into four parts. The first day of the workshop honored some of the pioneers of the field. Ralph Gomory's path-breaking paper, showing how the simplex algorithm could be generalized to provide a finite algorithm for integer programming and published in 1958, provided the justification of the an- niversary celebration. The activities of the first day, led by George Nemhauser and Bill Pulleyblank, included a panel discussion with the pioneers who attended the viiviii Preface workshop (Egon Balas, Michel Balinski, Jack Edmonds, Arthur Geoffrion, Ralph Gomory and Richard Karp) as well as three invited talks by Bill Cook, G Ì erard Cornu Ì ejols and Laurence Wolsey on integer programming and combinatorial op- timization from the beginnings to the state-of-the-art. The whole day is captured in two Video DVDs which come with the book (Part IV). Parts I, II, and III contain 20 papers of historical and current interest. Part I of the book, entitled The Early Years, presents, in order of publication date, reprints of eleven fundamental papers published between 1954 and 1979. Ten of these papers were selected by one or more of the authors of the paper, who also wrote new introductions to the papers that explain their motivations for working on the problems addressed and their reason for selecting the paper for inclusion in this volume. The authors are Egon Balas, Michel Balinski, Alison Doig, Jack Edmonds, Arthur Geoffrion, Ralph Gomory, Alan Hoffman, Richard Karp, Joseph Kruskal, Harold Kuhn, and Ailsa Land. Each of these heavily cited papers has had a major influence on the development of the field and lasting value. The eleventh selection, which starts this section, is a groundbreaking paper by George Dantzig, Ray Fulkerson, and Selmer Johnson, with an introduction by VaË sek Chv Ì atal and William Cook. The introduction to Part I closes with a list, in chronological order, of our selection of some of the most influential papers appearing between 1954 and 1973 pertaining to the many facets of integer programming. Part II contains papers based on the talks given by Cornu Ì ejols, Cook, and Wolsey. The paper Polyhedral Approaches to Mixed Integer Programming by Michele Con- forti, G Ì erard Cornu Ì ejols, and Giacomo Zambelli presents tools from polyhedral the- ory that are used in integer programming. It applies them to the study of valid inequalities for mixed integer linear sets, such as Gomory's mixed integer cuts. The study of combinatorial optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem has had a significant influence on integer programming. Fifty-plus Years of Combinatorial Integer Programming by Bill Cook discusses these connections. In solving integer programming problems by branch-and-bound methods, it is impor- tant to use relaxations that provide tight bounds. In the third paper entitled Refor- mulation and Decomposition of Integer Programs, Franc Ì§ ois Vanderbeck and Lau- rence Wolsey survey ways to reformulate integer and mixed integer programs to obtain stronger linear programming relaxations. Together, these three papers give a remarkably broad and comprehensive survey of developments in the last fifty-plus years and their impacts on state-of-the-art theory and methodology. Six survey talks on current hot topics in integer programming were given at the workshop by Fritz Eisenbrand, Andrea Lodi, Franc Ì§ ois Margot, Franz Rendl, Jean- Philippe P. Richard, and Robert Weismantel. These talks covered topics that are actively being researched now and likely to have substantial influence in the coming decade and beyond. Part III contains the six papers that are based on these talks. Integer Programming and Algorithmic Geometry of Numbers by Fritz Eisenbrand surveys some of the most important results from the interplay of integer programming and the geome- try of numbers. Nonlinear Integer Programming by Raymond Hemmecke, Matthias K Ì oppe, Jon Lee, and Robert Weismantel generalizes the usual integer programmingPreface ix model by studying integer programs with nonlinear objective functions. Mixed Inte- ger Programming Computation by Andrea Lodi discusses the important ingredients involved in building a successful mixed integer solver as well as the problems that need to be solved in building the next generation of faster and more stable solvers. Symmetry is a huge obstacle encountered in solving mixed integer programs ef- ficiently. In Symmetry in Integer Programming, Franc Ì§ ois Margot presents several techniques that have been used successfully to overcome this difficulty. Semidefi- nite programming is a generalization of linear programming that provides a tighter relaxation to integer programs than linear programs. In Semidefinite Relaxations for Integer Programming, Franz Rendl surveys how semidefinite models and algorithms can be used effectively in solving certain combinatorial optimization problems. In the 1960s Ralph Gomory created a new tight relaxation for integer programs based on group theory. Recently the group theoretic model has been revived in the study of two-row integer programs. In The Group-Theoretic Approach in Mixed Integer Programming, Jean-Philippe P. Richard and Santanu S. Dey provide an overview of the mathematical foundations and recent theoretical and computational advances in the study of the group-theoretic approach. We close with the hope that the next fifty years will be as rich as the last fifty have been in theoretical and practical accomplishments in integer programming.},
